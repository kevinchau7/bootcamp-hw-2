                    Hon chau, I m a asian from Hong Kong. I like hiking, biking, watching movies, and have a good meal with friends. 
                    Austin is indeed the best place to place even in pandemic. This city has a lot of food restaurants from around the world. Most my friends all live around here. 
                    I m also a tech savy. I like to explore the best computers, phones, software and apps in the industry. As such, i used to like shopping at the mall, best buy and frys electronics. 
                    I m currently taking several IT programming courses , which will help me to find a career in the IT area. Thank you.
